                    <h1>Paciific Area - About the New Zealand Temple</h1>
                    <p>Situated atop a stately hill in the rural outskirts of Hamilton, the Hamilton New Zealand Temple 
                        overlooks the 86 acres it shares with the former Church College of New Zealand—a Church-operated 
                        school for students ages twelve to eighteen that permanently closed in December 2009 after 51 years 
                        of operation. At the base of the hill is a popular public visitors' center, surrounded by beautifully 
                        manicured gardens. Guides are available to answer questions and direct visitors to the numerous displays 
                        on site including a magnificent replica of the Christus statue. At Christmastime, the grounds are filled 
                        with a dazzling spectacle of lights and displays.</p>

                <div>Temple Quote
                    "If we can literally be 'caught up' in any work in the church, it is this work relating to genealogical research and to the temples. This, because there is the spirit of Elijah. The prophets have spoken of it. The Saints have felt it; and following the inspiration of it they have come to the temple to do the sacred work for both the living and the dead."
                    —Boyd K. Packer.
                    <p>Temple Quote
                        "I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name."</p>
                <p>Temple Quote
                    "Just as our Redeemer gave His life as a vicarious sacrifice for all men, and in so doing became our Savior, even so we, in a small measure, when we engage in proxy work in the temple, become as saviors to those on the other side."</p>
